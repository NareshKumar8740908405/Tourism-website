                        <p>Jaipur, city, capital of Rajasthan state, northwestern India. It is situated in the east-central part of the state, roughly equidistant from Alwar (northeast) and Ajmer (southwest). It is Rajasthan’s most-populous city.The main attraction of Jaipur is its archetypal architecture. The city was planned as per the Indian Vastu Shastra, a science that promotes well being and prosperity.Here the past comes alive in magnificent forts and palaces, blushed pink, where once lived the maharajas. The bustling bazaars of Jaipur, famous for Rajasthan jewellery, fabric and shoes, possess a timeless quality and are a treasure-trove for the shoppers.</p>

                        <p>
                        The story goes that in 1876, the Prince of Wales visited India on a tour. Since the colour pink was symbolic of hospitality, Maharaja Ram Singh of Jaipur painted the entire city pink. The pink that colours the city makes for a marvellous spectacle to behold. Jaipur rises up majestically against the backdrop of the forts Nahargarh, Jaigarh and Garh Ganesh Temple.Jaipur traces back its origins to 1727 when it was established by Jai Singh II, the Raja of Amber. He shifted his capital from Amber to the new city because of the rapidly-growing population and an increasing water scarcity. Noted architect Vidyadhar Bhattacharya used the established principles of Vastu Shastra to build the city.

                <h2>Hawa Mahal</h2>

                <p>Hawa Mahal, literally the Palace of Winds, was built in 1799 by the poet king Sawai Pratap Singh as a summer retreat for him and his family. It also served as a place where the ladies of the royal household could observe everyday life without being seen themselves. This unique five-storey structure is a blend of Hindu and Islamic architecture, and the exterior, with its small latticed windows (called jharokhas), resembles the crown of Lord Krishna. The windows also serve as an air-conditioner of sorts, blowing cool air throughout the palace, making it the perfect retreat during summers. Built from pink sandstone, the Hawa Mahal is Jaipur’s iconic landmark and visitors can view its complete magnificence from outside, from across the road. However, it is also possible to climb right up to the top for a wonderful view from the windows. Today, the Mahal is maintained by the Archaeological Department of the Government of Rajasthan and also houses an archaeological museum in the courtyard.

                <h2>Amber Palace</h2>

                <p>Amber (pronounced Amer) is at a distance of about 11 kilometres from Jaipur. Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it was the bastion of the Kachwahas of Amber, until the capital was moved to the plains, to what is today Jaipur. The palace, located in craggy hills, is a beautiful melange of Hindu and Mughal styles. Raja Man Singh I began construction in 1592 and the palace, which was built as a strong, safe haven against attacking enemies, was completed by Mirja Raja Jai Singh. The contrast between the harsh exterior and the inviting interior couldn’t be more surprising. Made entirely of red sandstone and white marble, visitors are left spellbound by the magnificence of the palace that utilises carvings, precious stones and mirrors. The splendour of the palace is enhanced by the breath-taking vista of the Maota Lake in front. The palace is nearly seven centuries old and has a legendary past. Originally a small structure that the Rajputs won from the Meena tribes, it was later transformed into the grand Amber Palace.</p>

                <h2>Nahargarh Fort</h2>

                <p>Nahargarh Fort sits proudly on a ridge of the Aravalli Hills, creating an impressive northern backdrop to the city of Jaipur. It was constructed during the reign of Jai Singh in 1734, and was later expanded in 1868. Nahargarh, which means abode of tigers, was a formidable barrier, defending Jaipur against attacking enemies. Within its walls, the fort houses Madhavendra Bhawan, the summer destination for the members of the royal family. Built by Sawai Madho Singh, the palace has 12 matching boudoirs for the queens, at the head of which is a suite for the king. They are all connected by corridors decorated with delicate murals. Even today the palace is a favoured spot for local picnickers. The fort looks brilliant when floodlit at night. Overlooking the city, it presents a glittering view of the city lights.</p>

                <h2>Galtaji</h2>

                <p>Galtaji is an ancient pilgrimage centre in Jaipur. Set amidst low hills and packed with locals and tourists alike, the attractive spot has temples, pavilions and holy kunds (natural springs and water tanks). Visitors to Galtaji will come across the complex of Ramgopalji temple, locally called the Monkey temple (Galwar Bagh). It gets this moniker because of a large group of resident monkeys. The green landscape and chattering monkeys add to the delight of the area. On top of the hill is a small temple dedicated to the sun god, called the Surya Mandir. Constructed by Diwan Kriparam, the temple can be seen from anywhere in the city.

                <h2>Dal Baati Churma</h2>

                <p>This is by far one of the most famous dishes of Rajasthan, so much so that there are folklore and songs about the dish! No quintessential Rajasthani meal can ever be complete without Dal Baati Churma. The round Baatis are served with Panchkuti Dal along with a hearty dose of Churma.
                The bastis are these round balls of dough that are stuffed and baked over charcoal fire, as a distant plump cousin of usual Indian rotis! Churma is the sweet accompaniment with the dish, made of jiggery or sugar and a hearty dose of ghee. The Panchkuti dal is lentil curry that adds the most flavor to the dish. Churmas come in various varieties based on the ingredients, so go try a few out and find your fave!</p>

                <p>Mawa Kachori is the sweet kachori that defies all stereotypes, one crunchy bite at a time.

For many, Mawa Kachori is a ceremonial treat, which is distributed in community gatherings, local festivals or temple foods.Unlike other variants of kachoris, Mawa Kachori is a wholly different story! Why? Because it is stuffed with sugary goodness, of mawa and is available in every local sweet shop, try it with a hefty serving of sugar syrup and you’ll be done for your afternoon slump!</p>
