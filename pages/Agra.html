                        <p>Agra is a city on the banks of the Yamuna river in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, about
                            210
                            kilometres (130 mi) south of the national capital New Delhi and 320 km west of the state
                            capital
                            Lucknow. With a population of roughly 1.6 million, Agra is the fourth-most populous city in
                            Uttar Pradesh and twenty-third most populous city in India.It is on the Golden Triangle tourist circuit with Delhi and Jaipur. It is famous for its Mughal architecture and for being home to one of the Seven Wonders of the World, the Taj Mahal.

                            Agra's notable historical period began during Sikandar Lodi's reign, but the golden age of
                            the
                            city began with the Mughals. Agra was the foremost city of the Indian subcontinent and the
                            capital of the Mughal Empire under Mughal emperors Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir and Shah
                            Jahan. Under Mughal rule, Agra became a centre for learning, arts, commerce, and religion,
                            and
                            saw the construction of the Agra Fort, Sikandra and Agra's most prized monument, the Taj
                            Mahal,
                            built by Shah Jahan as a mausoleum for his favourite empress. With the decline of the Mughal
                            empire in the late 18th century, the city fell successively first to Marathas and later to
                            the
                            East India Company. After Independence, Agra has developed into an industrial town, with a
                            booming tourism industry, along with footwear, leather and other manufacturing.

                <h2>Taj Mahal</h2>

                <p>“The embodiment of all things pure”, said Rudyard Kipling on Taj Mahal’s beauty and that is no
                    wordplay as the Taj is undoubtedly a pure epitome of beauty. It is an immortal poem in white marble
                    and is the finest expression of love of an emperor for his queen. Located on a bank of River Yamuna,
                    it was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife and Queen Mumtaz Mahal in
                    1631, who died giving birth to his child and whose last wish to her husband was “to build such a
                    tomb in her memory which the world has never seen before.” It took over 17 years, 22000 workers and
                    1000 elephants to build the wonderful mausoleum. <br>
                    The Taj Mahal is one of the three World Heritage Sites in India. Set in a serene Mughal Garden the
                    monument stands on a raised marble platform, with its back towards Yamuna River. The four sides of
                    the Taj Mahal show a perfect symmetry and feature impressive vaulted arches embellished with Pietra
                    Dura scrollwork, and verses from the Quran in calligraphy using inlaid jasper. This architectural
                    masterpiece is one of the most frequented places in India by photographers and foreign tourists. The
                    Taj Mahal looks as immaculate today as when it was first built, leaving the onlookers mesmerized.

                <h2>Agra Fort</h2>

                <p>A massive red-sandstone fort located on the banks of River Yamuna was built under the commission of
                    Emperor Akbar in 1565 and was further built by his grandson Shah Jahan. The fort, semi-circular on
                    plan, is surrounded by a 21.4 m high fortification wall. The fort was built primarily as a military
                    structure; parts of it are still reserved under Indian Army. Shah Jahan transformed it into a
                    palace, later it became his gilded prison for eight years after his son Aurangzeb seized power in
                    1658. The fort houses a maze of buildings, including vast underground sections. The Amar Singh Gate
                    to the south is the sole entry point. A path leads straight from here up to the large Moti Masjid.
                    Just before this is the open Diwan-e-Aam, where Shah Jahan listened to people’s petitions or issues.
                    A small staircase just to the left of Diwan-e-Aam throne leads up to a large courtyard. To the left
                    is a beautiful white marble Nagina Masjid. Other places to see within the Fort are: Diwan-e-Khas -
                    which once housed Shah Jahan’s legendary Peacock throne and the diamond Koh-I-Noor, Shish Mahal- a
                    palace with walls inlaid with tiny mirrors, and Khas Mahal - the white octagonal tower and palace.
                    In the South of the fort, there is a huge red-sandstone Jahangir’s Palace, built by Akbar probably
                    for his son Jahangir.</p>

                <p>Ram Bagh is one of the earliest Mughal gardens, believed to be laid out by Mughal Emperor Babur, the
                    founder of Mughal Dynasty. The Garden is located just 3 KMs away from the Tomb of Itmad-Ud_Daula and
                    500 meters away from the Chini ka Rauza. It is Agra’s oldest garden which was established in 1528,
                    and is an oasis in the thick of a bustling market. It is said that Babur was temporarily buried here
                    before being taken to Kabul in Afghanistan. It was established by Babur and was later renovated by
                    Noor Jahan, wife of Jahangir.</p>

                <p>The Mughlai Food is a souvenir of the Mughal era in India.The food has been borrowed from the Mughal
                    kitchen.The Mughlai dish mainly consists of meat enriched with creamy, boldly flavoured curries;
                    with lots of dried fruits with ground as well as whole spices. As time passed, the Mughlai dishes
                    travelled from Agra to different parts of North India. However, the taste of Mughlai food in Agra is
                    special and delicious. When the Mughals made Agra the Capital city of India in the 16th century,
                    they left indelible imprints on the cuisine of Agra. The best places to get the lip smacking and
                    original taste of the Mughlai food in Agra are areas like Nai ki Mandi area on MG road, Indiana,

                    The bhalla in Agra is a fried potato and chickpea patty that’s smashed open and topped with grated
                    ginger and a spicy-sweet tamarind sauce. The Bhallas here are made bigger and crispier than the
                    others. This is a perfectly satisfying snack that can only be found on the streets of Agra. To enjoy
                    the true taste of the chaat in Agra one can explorechaat wali gali in sadar bazar.</p>
