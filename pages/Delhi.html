                <h2>India Gate</h2>

                <p>India Gate, official name Delhi Memorial, originally called All-India War Memorial, monumental sandstone arch in New Delhi, dedicated to the troops of British India who died in wars fought between 1914 and 1919. India Gate, which is located at the eastern end of the Rajpath (formerly called the Kingsway), is about 138 feet (42 metres) in height.
                India Gate is one of many British monuments built by order of the Imperial War Graves Commission (later renamed Commonwealth War Graves Commission). The architect was Sir Edwin Lutyens, an Englishman who designed numerous other war memorials and was also the principal planner of New Delhi. The cornerstone was laid in 1921 by the duke of Connaught, third son of Queen Victoria. Construction of the All-India War Memorial, as it was originally known, continued until 1931, the year of the formal dedication of New Delhi as the capital of India.

                <h2>The Red Fort</h2>

                <p>The Red Fort Complex was built as the palace fort of Shahjahanabad – the new capital of the fifth Mughal Emperor of India, Shah Jahan. Named for its massive enclosing walls of red sandstone, it is adjacent to an older fort, the Salimgarh, built by Islam Shah Suri in 1546, with which it forms the Red Fort Complex. The private apartments consist of a row of pavilions connected by a continuous water channel, known as the Nahr-i-Behisht (Stream of Paradise). The Red Fort is considered to represent the zenith of Mughal creativity which, under the Shah Jahan, was brought to a new level of refinement. The planning of the palace is based on Islamic prototypes, but each pavilion reveals architectural elements typical of Mughal building, reflecting a fusion of Persian, Timurid and Hindu traditions The Red Fort’s innovative planning and architectural style, including the garden design, strongly influenced later buildings and gardens in Rajasthan, Delhi, Agra and further afield.</p>

                <h2>The Lotus Temple</h2>

                <p>The Lotus Temple (also known as Kamal Mandir)  in Delhi is a matchless architectural marvel and one of the prime tourist attractions of the National Capital. Shaped in the form of a spectacular lotus with white petals, it makes for a break-taking sight and attracts countless visitors throughout the year. Unlike most other places of worship, this temple or Bahai House of Worship does not allow ritualistic ceremonies and has no fixed pattern to conduct worship. A glorious symbol of oneness, this place of worship must be on your itinerary when planning a trip and booking your hotels in Delhi.</p>

                <h2>Qutub Minar</h2>

                <p>Qutab Minar is a soaring, 73 m-high tower of victory, built in 1193 by Qutab-ud-din Aibak immediately after the defeat of Delhi's last Hindu kingdom. The tower has five distinct storeys, each marked by a projecting balcony and tapers from a 15 m diameter at the base to just 2.5 m at the top. The first three storeys are made of red sandstone; the fourth and fifth storeys are of marble and sandstone. At the foot of the tower is the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, the first mosque to be built in India. An inscription over its eastern gate provocatively informs that it was built with material obtained from demolishing '27 Hindu temples'. A 7 m-high iron pillar stands in the courtyard of the mosque. It is said that if you can encircle it with your hands while standing with your back to it your wish will be fulfilled.

        <h1>Food to Eat in Delhi:</h1>

        <div class="content-1">

            <div class="Taj-content">

                <h2>Chole Bhature</h2>

                <p>It is but obvious that this list should start with Chole Bhature. Eaten for breakfast, lunch or even just as a snack, if there is one Delhi dish that you must try, it is this. Every street corner has a stall, dishing out round baseball-like bhaturas, hot from the kadhai (wok). The magic, I have realised, is in the chole. Very few get that right and those who do, assume legendary status. Delhi swears by Baba Nagpal Corner in Lajpat Nagar and Sitaram Diwan Chand in Paharganj. However, if you happen to be in Noida or its whereabouts, do try Sagar's Special Paneer Wale Chole Bhature outside ICICI Bank in Sector 18, Noida.</p>

                <h2>Parathas</h2>

                <p>Ask anyone who studied in Delhi and they will tell you about the parathas that helped them get by. Though Chur Chur Naans may be finding their way onto street stalls, stuffed parathas have always ruled and shall continue to do so. However, do not follow popular lists and be compelled to make the trek to Chandni Chowk for a taste of Parathe Wali Gali. The parathas there are deep fried and in my opinion, highly overrated. There are plenty of local stalls and dhabas which do better versions. For nostalgia sake, you could head to Qutub Institutional Area where any student will be happy to guide you to Laxman Dhaba.</p>

                <h2>Momos</h2>

                <p>A popular snack in Delhi, momos or dim sums are one of the most loved evening bites of the Delhiites. Moving beyond the original steamed and fried variations, people in Delhi have added a north Indian twist to this Tibetan delight. Various stops in Delhi these days serve Tandoori momos (marinated tandoor grilled momos) that present one of the best fusion examples of food. The spicy charred exteriors mix in with flavorful steamed interiors and are loaded with the merriment of exceptional flavors.</p>

                <h2>Kulfi</h2>

                <p>The name comes from Persia where it refers to a covered cup. A denser and creamier form of ice-cream, kulfi is said to have been invented during the Mughal Era somewhere in North India. Summer meals are often incomplete in Delhi without a kulfi stick to round it up, and so you will always find a kulfi corner at Delhi weddings too. The kulfi sold outside Moets in Defence Colony Market is popular all year round as is Roshan di Kulfi in Karol Bagh. If you're feeling adventurous, Chandni Chowk, the Mecca of food lovers, has something unique to offer. Kuremal Mohanlal Kulfiwale innovates with kulfi and stuffs real fruits like mango, custard apple, etc. with the creamy mix before freezing it.</p>
